# Statistics, Bias, Vizualization

## Anscombe's Quartet

- Often used to illustrate the importance of data vizualization before any statistical analysis
- Statistics don't always tell the whole (data) history
- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet)

## Beware

- Sampling Bias
- Context matters when analyzing data
- Extrapolation
- Percentages can be misleading
- *"Make sure that you understand what is actually being measured and how those “statistically significant” results were computed before you jump to conclusion"*, J. Guttag

## Don't forget

- *"If you torture the data long enough, it will confess to anything."*, Darrell Huff, How to Lie with Statistics, 1954
