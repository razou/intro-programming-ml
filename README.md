# intro-programming-ml

This repo is based on the book by J. Guttag (title and table of content below). 
It covers some computer science concepts with python applications as well as general machine learning topics. 
We reproduced the examples with python 3 and provided data sets. 
You will need a few libraries listed in `requirement.txt` to run the examples.
