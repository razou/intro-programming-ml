## Machine learning

### Definition

- Hard to define
- *"Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."*, definition proposed by Arthur Samuel

### ML Approaches' structure

- An ML approach has generally three components
  1. A representation of the model (or Approach)
  2. An objective function for assessing the goodness of the model
  3. An optimization method for learning a model that minimizes or maximizes the value of the objective function.

### ML approaches' types

- Suppervised learning
  - Attempt to derive from these pairs a rule that predicts the value associated with a previously unseen feature vector
  - Examples
    - Regression
    - Classification
- Unsupervised learning
  - Try to uncover latent (i.e., not directly observed) structure in the data
  - Examples
    - clustering

## Feature vectors

- The **signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)**: measure used in various fields, including engineering, physics, and statistics, to quantify the ratio of a signal's strength to the background noise or interference.
  - **Signal (S):** the useful or desired information in a system or measurement.
  - **Noise (N):** any unwanted or irrelevant or random variations or disturbances in the data.

### Feature engineering

- *"The purpose of **feature engineering** is to separate those features in the available data that contribute to the signal from those that are merely noise. Failure to do an adequate job of this can lead to a bad model. The danger is particularly high when the dimensionality of the data (i.e., the number of different features) is large relative to the number of samples"*. J. V. Guttag (second edition, page 375)
- *"Successful **feature engineering** is an abstraction process that reduces the vast amount of information that might be available to information from which it will be productive to generalize"* J. V. Guttag (second edition, page 375)
